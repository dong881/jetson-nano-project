# Changelog - Future Enhancements Implementation

## Version 2.0 - Enhanced Features Release

### Summary
This release implements all 6 future enhancements requested for the Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning project, adding significant new capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

### New Features âœ¨

#### 1. Multiple Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Slower speed (10 FPS), larger board (800x600)
- **Medium**: Default speed (15 FPS), standard board (640x480)
- **Hard**: Faster speed (25 FPS), smaller board (480x360)
- Toggle with UI button or `D` keyboard shortcut
- Applies to both Human and Training modes

#### 2. Advanced RL Algorithms
- **DQN** (Deep Q-Network): Original algorithm with experience replay
- **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization): Policy gradient method
- **A3C** (Advantage Actor-Critic): Stable actor-critic learning
- Switch algorithms with UI button or `A` keyboard shortcut
- Each algorithm has separate model storage

#### 3. Leaderboard System
- Tracks top 10 scores across all sessions
- Filters by mode (human/DQN/PPO/A3C) and difficulty
- Persistent JSON storage (`leaderboard.json`)
- Toggle display with `L` keyboard shortcut
- Automatic score submission on game end

#### 4. Multi-Agent Training
- Support for 2-4 agents training simultaneously
- Agents compete for food on the same board
- Collision detection between agents
- Independent scoring and food for each agent
- Color-coded snakes for easy identification
- Separate demo script included

#### 5. Custom Reward Shaping
- Four pre-configured reward profiles:
  - **Default**: Standard +10/-10 rewards
  - **Encouraging**: Higher rewards, lower penalties
  - **Strict**: Harsh penalties, efficiency focus
  - **Shaped**: Distance-based rewards
- Configurable parameters:
  - Food reward
  - Death penalty
  - Step penalty
  - Closer-to-food reward
- Easy to create custom profiles in `config.py`

#### 6. Policy Visualization
- Real-time Q-value display in training mode
- Shows AI's decision-making process
- Action highlighting (which action will be chosen)
- State information overlay
- Exploration rate indicator
- Toggle with `V` keyboard shortcut

### Technical Details

- **Net Change**: +1,835 lines
- **Files Changed**: 13
- **Tests**: 31 total (21 new + 10 original)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% passing

### UI Enhancements

#### New Buttons
- **Difficulty Button**: Cycle through difficulty levels
- **Algorithm Button**: Switch between RL algorithms
- **Leaderboard Button**: Show/hide leaderboard overlay
- **Policy Viz Button**: Toggle policy visualization

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `L` - Toggle leaderboard
- `D` - Cycle difficulty
- `A` - Cycle algorithm
- `V` - Toggle policy visualization
- Arrow Keys - Control snake (Human mode)

#### Screen Layout
- Increased screen width to 1000px
- Enhanced stats panel with more information
- Policy visualization overlay
- Leaderboard modal overlay

### Testing

All features have comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests for UI components
- Backward compatibility tests
- Performance tests

### Backward Compatibility

All original features remain functional:
- Human play mode works as before
- DQN training continues to work
- Model loading/saving unchanged
- High score system maintained
- All original tests pass

### Performance

- DQN: Fastest training, most stable
- PPO: Slower training, better final performance
- A3C: Medium speed, good for continuous learning
- Multi-agent: Slower due to multiple agents

### File Storage

New files created by the system:
- `leaderboard.json` - Leaderboard database
- `model/ppo_model.pth` - PPO model weights
- `model/a3c_model.pth` - A3C model weights
- `model/multi_agent_*.pth` - Multi-agent models

### Documentation

Complete documentation provided:
- `README.md` - Overview and quick start
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details
- `FEATURES_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This changelog
- Code comments throughout

### Known Limitations

- Multi-agent training is slower due to multiple agents
- PPO and A3C may require more training episodes than DQN
- Policy visualization only available in Training mode
- Maximum 4 agents supported in multi-agent mode

### Future Work

Potential additional enhancements:
- Neural network architecture selection
- Hyperparameter tuning UI
- Training progress graphs
- Model comparison tools
- Replay system for recorded games
