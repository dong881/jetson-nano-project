# Fix Summary: CUDA Library Path Configuration

## Problem
The application was failing with:
```
OSError: libcurand.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
jetson-nano-project-snake-game-1 exited with code 1
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile did not configure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include CUDA library locations. While docker-compose.yml set this as an environment variable, PyTorch imports during container startup before those environment variables were fully processed, causing it to fail finding CUDA libraries.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dockerfile Changes
- **Added** `ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with comprehensive CUDA paths:
  ```dockerfile
  ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ```
- **Removed** CUDA stub libraries that could conflict with nvidia-container-runtime
- **Created** `check_cuda.sh` startup diagnostics script
- **Updated** CMD to run diagnostics before starting the application

### 2. docker-compose.yml Changes
- **Removed** redundant LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (now in Dockerfile)
- **Kept** `/usr/local/cuda` volume mount for accessing host CUDA libraries

### 3. New Tools Created
- **`check_cuda.sh`**: Startup script that checks for CUDA libraries and provides helpful error messages if they're missing
- **`verify_jetson_setup.sh`**: Pre-deployment verification script that checks all prerequisites on Jetson Nano

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Enhanced **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** with detailed CUDA troubleshooting steps
- Updated **DEPENDENCIES.md** with LD_LIBRARY_PATH documentation
- Updated **README.md** and **QUICKSTART.md** with verification instructions
- Added comprehensive entry to **CHANGELOG.md**

## How to Deploy

### On Your Jetson Nano:

1. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin copilot/fix-snake-game-issues
   ```

2. **Run the verification script** (recommended):
   ```bash
   chmod +x verify_jetson_setup.sh
   ./verify_jetson_setup.sh
   ```
   
   This will check:
   - JetPack/L4T version
   - CUDA installation
   - Docker and nvidia-container-runtime
   - X11 configuration

3. **Build and run**:
   ```bash
   xhost +local:docker
   docker compose down  # Stop any old containers
   docker compose build --no-cache
   docker compose up
   ```

## Expected Output

### On Successful Startup:
```
======================================== 
CUDA Library Configuration Check
========================================
LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:...

Searching for CUDA libraries...
Found libcurand in: /usr/local/cuda/lib64

Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html

```

### If CUDA Libraries Not Found:
The startup script will show a warning but continue:
```
⚠ WARNING: libcurand not found in expected locations

This error typically means:
  1. JetPack is not installed on your Jetson Nano
  2. The /usr/local/cuda volume mount is not working
  3. nvidia-container-runtime is not properly configured

Please check:
  - JetPack 4.6.x is installed on the host
  - /usr/local/cuda exists on the host
  - nvidia-container-runtime is installed and working

Continuing anyway - the application may fail...
```

## Troubleshooting

### If the error still occurs:

1. **Check CUDA installation on your Jetson Nano**:
   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcurand.so*
   ```
   
   If this doesn't exist, you need to install JetPack 4.6.x

2. **Check nvidia-container-runtime**:
   ```bash
   docker info | grep -i runtime
   # Should show: Runtimes: nvidia runc
   ```

3. **Check Docker logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs
   ```

4. **See detailed troubleshooting**:
   Refer to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for comprehensive solutions

## Files Changed

### Modified:
- `Dockerfile` - Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH, removed stub libraries
- `docker-compose.yml` - Simplified configuration
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Enhanced CUDA troubleshooting
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` - Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH docs
- `README.md` - Added verification instructions
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Added verification step
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented all changes

### Created:
- `check_cuda.sh` - Startup diagnostics script
- `verify_jetson_setup.sh` - Pre-deployment verification script
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Why This Fix Works

1. **LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Dockerfile**: Ensures the path is set during image build, before PyTorch tries to load
2. **Multiple library paths**: Covers different possible CUDA installation locations
3. **Startup diagnostics**: Provides immediate feedback if something is wrong
4. **Pre-deployment verification**: Catches issues before attempting to run the container
5. **Better documentation**: Users can troubleshoot issues themselves

## Prevention for Future

- Always set critical environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the Dockerfile, not just docker-compose.yml
- Include startup diagnostics for complex dependencies like CUDA
- Provide verification scripts for prerequisite checks
- Document expected behavior and common issues

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Verify the game runs correctly in human mode
2. Test the training mode to ensure CUDA acceleration works
3. Check PyTorch CUDA availability with the game's diagnostics

If issues persist, please:
1. Run `./verify_jetson_setup.sh` and share the output
2. Run `docker compose logs` and share the full logs
3. Open a GitHub issue with the diagnostic information
