# Docker Compose CUDA Library Error Fix

## Problem Analysis
The Docker Compose error was caused by a missing CUDA library symlink for `libcufft.so.10`. The error occurred when PyTorch tried to load CUDA dependencies:

```
OSError: libcufft.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
The `check_cuda.sh` script was looking for specific CUDA library versions (e.g., `libcufft.so.10.0`) but the actual libraries in the container might have different version numbers. The symlink creation logic was too rigid and couldn't handle version variations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CUDA Library Detection (`check_cuda.sh`)
- **Flexible Library Finding**: Updated the script to search for CUDA libraries with flexible version matching
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Added fallback symlink creation for missing libraries
- **Comprehensive Verification**: Added verification step to check if critical libraries are accessible
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and warnings

### 2. Improved Dockerfile
- **Additional Library Paths**: Added more CUDA library paths to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- **Initial Symlink Creation**: Added initial CUDA library symlink creation in the Docker image as a fallback
- **Robust Library Discovery**: Uses `find` commands to locate libraries regardless of version numbers

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### In `check_cuda.sh`:
- Updated `find_cuda_libs()` function to check for multiple CUDA libraries (libcurand, libcufft, libcublas, libcudart)
- Enhanced symlink creation with flexible version matching
- Added fallback symlink creation for missing libraries
- Added verification step to ensure critical libraries are accessible

#### In `Dockerfile`:
- Added `/usr/local/cuda-10.2/targets/aarch64-linux/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- Added initial CUDA library symlink creation in the image
- Uses flexible `find` commands to locate libraries with any version number

## Expected Result
The Docker Compose should now start successfully without the `libcufft.so.10` error. The enhanced script will:
1. Find CUDA libraries with flexible version matching
2. Create appropriate symlinks for PyTorch compatibility
3. Verify that critical libraries are accessible
4. Provide clear error messages if libraries are still missing

## Testing
To test the fix, run:
```bash
sudo docker compose up
```

The container should now start without CUDA library errors and the snake game should run successfully.
